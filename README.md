hnla-bp-nav-menu
================

The purpose of the files in this repo are to implement the new BuddyPress bp_nav_menu() function that was rolled out with BP 1.7. The template files re-factor the members/single/ templates to remove the older navigational functions and introduce the new function in home.php. Along with the templates are a set of styles designed to provide minimal styling and mimic the look of the old menus viewed under TwentyTwelve. Styles are enqueued via a set of functions which require dropping into the themes functions.php file.
